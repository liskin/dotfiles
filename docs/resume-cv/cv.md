**Principal Software Engineer**
[[GoodData](https://www.gooddata.com/) (Brno, CZ)]{}
**2017–2019**

* Ran continuous integration and deployment infrastructure and build tooling for 100 engineers.

* Reviewed and merged hundreds of pull requests across multiple repositories.

* Sped up our JIRA deployment so much that I got Thank-you emails from the grumpiest engineers.

* Contributed patches to [jenkins-job-builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/) and [python-jenkins](https://pypi.org/project/python-jenkins/). Became a co-maintainer of both.

* Made builds of dozens of components more reproducible, secure and scalable using Docker.

* Set up a merge queue for the legacy monolith with 4-hour integration tests, saving its developers hours of wasted time every week.

* Built a tool for tracking individual test failures in JIRA, helping developers of shared codebases.

* _Tech:_ Python, Perl, Bash, Jenkins, Zuul, Groovy, Java, Docker, Puppet, RPM

**Backend Software Engineer**
[[SQLdep](https://sqldep.com/) (Brno, CZ)]{}
**2015–2016**

* Collaborated on a multi-dialect SQL parser and visual data flow (lineage) analyzer.

* Administered the CI infrastructure and introduced continuous deployment for the backend.

* Scaled the analyzer using parallel workers and a job queue. Set up logging and monitoring.

* Prototyped on-premise deployment of the cloud-first product for customers in regulated industries.

* Tackled tech debt: refactored the codebase into independent components, sped up tests and builds.

* _Tech:_ Scala, Perl, SQL, Jenkins, Ansible

**Technical Co-founder**
[[Briskat](https://www.briskat.com/) (Brno, CZ)]{}
**2014–2014**

* Developed a prototype of a high-performance interactive database primarily for Online Analytical Processing, capable of processing millions of rows in milliseconds on commodity hardware.

* Used caching and data compression (with some pre-/post-processing tricks to improve compression effectiveness) to reduce CPU work and improve memory bandwidth utilization.

* Designed data structures and algorithms for efficient data storage, sorting, joining and querying.

* _Tech:_ Erlang, C, x86 ASM

**Senior Software Engineer**
[[GoodData](https://www.gooddata.com/) (Brno, CZ)]{}

* Developed a second-generation Extensible Analytics Engine (XAE), the core of GoodData platform.

* Built an optimizing compiler from Multi-Dimension Analytical Query Language to SQL.

* Tested the SQL backend against a reference implementation of the semantics using QuickCheck.

* Set up regression testing infrastructure using both synthetic and production data. This ensured correctness, prevented performance regressions and allowed us to run performance experiments.

* Pioneered CI (test results within a minute of git push) and CD (using Erlang hot code reloading).

* Had my sleep interrupted due to production incidents less than 5 times: XAE uses small workers (microservices) with almost no moving parts, serving millions of reports daily.

* Promoted to Senior Software Engineer after we fully migrated to the second generation XAE.

* _Tech:_ Perl, Erlang, Haskell, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, Puppet, Splunk
